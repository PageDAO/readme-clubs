# PAGE Token Dashboard Integration - Progress Report

## Completed
- [x] Integrated InterChainTokenProvider to aggregate data from EVM chains and Cosmos chains
- [x] Fixed type errors in InterChainTokenProvider.tsx
- [x] Fixed useTokenBalance and useTokenReserves arguments
- [x] Successfully loading ETH price data (currently ~$2021)
- [x] Successfully loading OSMO price data (currently ~$0.259)
- [x] Successfully calculating PAGE token prices across chains
- [x] Reading on-chain balances for connected wallets

## Current Issues
- [x] Fixed TypeScript errors in InterChainTokenProvider.tsx
- [x] Fixed argument mismatches in hook calls

## Next Steps
1. Update TokenDashboard.tsx to display both EVM and Cosmos chain data
   - Create a chain card component for Cosmos chains
   - Add Keplr wallet connect button for Cosmos chains
   - Display Osmosis TVL and price data

2. Implement Token Supply Distribution visualization
   - Show how PAGE tokens are distributed across different chains
   - Create a pie chart or bar chart to visualize distribution

3. Add links to DEXes for trading PAGE on each chain
   - Link to Uniswap for Ethereum
   - Link to BaseSwap for Base
   - Link to Velodrome for Optimism
   - Link to Osmosis for Cosmos

4. Add performance optimization
   - Implement caching for price data
   - Add loading states and error handling for all data sources

## Notes
- Logs show successful price calculations for PAGE on multiple chains:
  - Ethereum: ~$0.00099
  - Base: ~$0.00147
  - Optimism: ~$0.00086
- User has PAGE balance on Base chain: 28549.92 PAGE
- Lit signature generation error in Orbis SDK can be ignored for token dashboard functionality
